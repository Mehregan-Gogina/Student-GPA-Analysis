# Student GPA Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project on student GPA data. The analysis is performed using Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview

The student GPA dataset contains information about students' academic performance, including their grades, courses, and other relevant details. The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset and extract meaningful insights about students' GPA trends and factors affecting their academic performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about students' GPAs and other related attributes. It is assumed to be available in the repository or provided by the user.

## Analysis

The analysis is performed using Jupyter Notebook. The following steps are taken in the analysis:

1. Data Loading: Load the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook.
2. Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset by handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns.
3. Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of different features and their relationships.
4. Data Visualization: Visualize the dataset using various plots to gain insights.
5. Statistical Analysis: Perform statistical analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the analysis:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

## Usage

To run the analysis, open the Jupyter Notebook (`student_gpa.ipynb`) and execute the cells. The notebook contains detailed explanations and code for each step of the analysis.

## Results

The results of the analysis are summarized in the notebook. Key findings and insights are highlighted, and any notable trends or patterns in the student GPA data are discussed.
